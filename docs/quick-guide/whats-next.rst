What's Next
===========

Awesome! You are now running an Ethereum node!

The next step is to get your client synced and more familiar with your
node.

For more info about how the node works and get sync info, please visit
our :doc:`User Guide </user-guide/about-user-guide>`.

.. tip::
  Remember that you can stake with your ARM board. If you have
  32 ETH check out our **Consensus clients** section and get your validator up
  and running.
