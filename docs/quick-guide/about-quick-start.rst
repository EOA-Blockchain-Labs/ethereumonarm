About Quick Start Guide
=======================

This Guide walks you through all steps to get an Ethereum node up and running
in an ARM board in a few minutes.

The process is pretty straightforward but you will need some basic Linux/Networking skills 
to complete the installation.

If you are looking for a more "user friendly" hardware node (with a fancy gui) you may want to take a look
into `Dappnode`_ or `Avado`_.

This is the installation process in a nutshell:

* Get your **ARM Board**
* **Download and flash** the Image into a MicroSD card
* **Connect the SSD** and the Ethernet Cable
* Power on the device
* Wait till the installation script finishes all tasks
* Boot up, enable and run the Ethereum software
