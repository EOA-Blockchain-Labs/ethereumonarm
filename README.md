# Ethereum on ARM

## Introduction
Ethereum on ARM provides a plug-and-play (PnP) Ubuntu Armbian image for various ARM64 boards, specifically designed to set up and run both Execution and Consensus clients as Systemd services. This turns the device into a Full Ethereum node or a home Staking box, with a focus on lowering the barriers for running Ethereum L1 or L2 nodes.

## Supported Devices
- NanoPC-T6
- Rock 5B
- Orange Pi 5 Plus
- Orange Pi 5

## Features
- **EOA-gui**: A console menu interface for easy setup of L1 or L2 Full/Archive nodes. (Alpha Stage)
- **Multiple Client Support**: Includes Geth, Erigon, Besu, Nethermind, Reth, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Lodestar and Lighthouse.
- **L2 Support**: Compatibility with Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Starknet, and Gnosis.
- **Distributed Validator Technology**: Research and implementation for enhanced decentralization.
- **Client Diversity**: Promotion of minority client adoption.
- **Advanced Monitoring Solutions**: Ready-to-use Prometheus and Grafana dashboards provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities, allowing for detailed insights and analytics of node performance and network health.
- **Optimized Operating System Configurations**: The project includes several enhancements over the default Armbian settings, specifically optimized for Ethereum node performance and stability, ensuring a smooth and efficient node operation experience.
