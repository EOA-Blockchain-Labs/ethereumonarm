Place here console templates for Prometheus.

In /usr/share/doc/prometheus/examples/ are sample templates that show what can
be done with Prometheus' templating language. They only cover some generic
cases, and you are encouraged to modify and expand them.

See http://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/consoles/ for more information.
