Welcome to the Ethereum on ARM documentation.

Ethereum on ARM is a set of custom Linux images for ARM boards
that run Ethereum clients as a Systemd service and automatically turns such devices
into full/staking Ethereum nodes.

**The image takes care of all the necessary steps to run a node,
from setting up the environment and formatting the disk
to installing, managing and running the Execution and Consensus clients.**

If you are familiar with Ethereum and have already ran
an Ethereum node you can jump to our :doc:`Quick Start </quick-guide/about-quick-start>` 
guide and get your node up and running in minutes.

If you need more info, please use the Quick Start to install the image 
and visit the :doc:`User Guide </user-guide/about-user-guide>` 
in order to get further info on Ethereum and how to manage the clients.

.. note::

  We are currently supporting 5 devices:

  * **NanoPC T6 (16 GB RAM). RECOMMENDED** 
  * **Radxa Rock 5B (16 GB RAM). RECOMMENDED**
  * **Orange Pi 5 Plus (16 GM RAM). RECOMMENDED**
  * Orange Pi 5 (16 GM RAM).
  * Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB RAM + external USB Disk). Currently outdated.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

For running a node, follow the step-by-step guide. 

The process is as follows:

* Download and flash the Image into an MicroSD card
* Connect the SSD (NVMe or USB depending on device) and the Ethernet Cable
* Power on the device
* Wait till the installation script finish all tasks (about 10-15 minutes)
* Run an Ethereum clients (one Execution client + one Consensus client)
