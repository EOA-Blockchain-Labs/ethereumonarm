# Chrony configuration adjustments for improved NTP time sync on Ethereum validators
#
# This configuration is modified to use Google's NTP servers as an attempt to reduce the
# time synchronization drift which was causing missed attestations. Observations showed that
# drift errors could spike up to 300ms with the default setup, but with the following changes,
# the error has been reduced consistently to under 40ms. Google's NTP servers use leap smear
# which adjusts for leap seconds gradually, avoiding abrupt time step changes.
#
# Adjustments include the use of 'minpoll' and 'maxpoll' to increase the frequency of sync,
# and it is important not to over-poll to avoid potential rate-limiting or banning by NTP
# service providers. The 'leapsectz' directive is commented out to accommodate servers using
# leap smearing. While this configuration works well for this specific use case, it is not a
# blanket recommendation for all users. Diversification of time sources and careful monitoring
# are advisable.
#
# Include any modifications or notes on specific changes below this line as part of standard
# configuration management practices.

# Welcome to the chrony configuration file. See chrony.conf(5) for more
# information about usable directives.
