Why Choose ARM Hardware?
========================

ARM-based Single Board Computers (SBCs) are widely considered the ideal hardware for running personal Ethereum nodes. They offer a perfect balance of performance, cost, and efficiency that is hard to match with traditional computers.

Here is why you should consider an ARM board for your node:

Energy Efficiency
-----------------

This is the most significant advantage. An ARM node (like the NanoPC T6 or Rock 5B) typically consumes between **5W and 15W** of power.

*   **Low Electricity Bills**: Compared to a standard desktop PC (which can consume 100W+), an ARM board costs a fraction to run 24/7.
*   **Eco-Friendly**: Consuming less energy reduces the environmental impact of the Ethereum network.

Cost-Effective
--------------

You can build a powerful, high-performance node for a very reasonable price.

*   **Affordable Hardware**: A complete setup (Board + RAM + Case + Power Supply) is often available for **under $200**. Even with a high-speed 2TB NVMe SSD, the total cost usually stays under **$350-$400**.
*   **High ROI**: For stakers, lower hardware and operational costs mean a higher Return on Investment.

Silent and Compact
------------------

ARM boards are designed for embedded systems, making them perfect for home environments.

*   **Silent Operation**: Many boards use passive cooling (no fans) or very quiet fans, so they make zero noise.
*   **Small Footprint**: They are credit-card sized or slightly larger, fitting easily on a shelf, in a closet, or beside your router without taking up space.

Dedicated Performance
---------------------

Unlike a personal computer that you might use for gaming or work, an ARM node is a dedicated device.

*   **Stability**: The device does one thing and does it well. It is not affected by other programs or user activities.
*   **Reliability**: With no moving parts (if potential fans are excluded) and simple architecture, they are extremely reliable for running 24/7 for years.

Plug & Play Experience
----------------------

With **Ethereum on ARM**, these devices become even easier to use. Our custom images are designed to:

*   **Just Flash & Run**: No complex Linux installation is required.
*   **Auto-Configuration**: The image handles disk formatting, network setup, and service management automatically.

In summary, ARM boards provide the most practical, economical, and efficient way to run your own Ethereum node at home.
