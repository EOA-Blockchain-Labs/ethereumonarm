Running an Optimism Supernode on Rock 5B (32GB) or Orange Pi 5 Plus
=======================================================================

This guide details how to set up an Optimism "Supernode" on a Rock 5B (32GB model) or an Orange Pi 5 Plus.  A Supernode runs both a Layer 1 (L1) Ethereum node and a Layer 2 (L2) Optimism node on the same hardware.  This allows you to participate in both the Ethereum mainnet and the Optimism network simultaneously.

.. warning::

   **32GB RAM Requirement:**  Running a Supernode requires a board with **32GB of RAM**.  This guide specifically applies to the **Rock 5B (32GB model)** and the **Orange Pi 5 Plus (32GB model)**.  Do *not* attempt this on devices with less RAM.

Software Prerequisites
----------------------

1.  **Flash the Ethereum on ARM Image:**

    Download the appropriate image for your board.  *Always verify the SHA256 checksum after downloading to ensure file integrity.*

    *   **For Rock 5B (32GB):**

        *   Download Link: `ethonarm_rock5b_24.09.00.img.zip <https://ethereumonarm-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/dlosada/EeYfOU29o3ZDgFv2yTCSjCQBkLb6_hjGF2GRzD65Ojpxag?download=1>`_
        *   SHA256 Checksum: ``849d44f6053d058216ea3138bce8455762edc5c7823d9734a8a8f5a62d26e612``

        Verify the checksum (in your terminal, after downloading):

        .. prompt:: bash $

            sha256sum ethonarm_rock5b_24.09.00.img.zip

        Compare the output to the checksum provided above.  They *must* match.

    *   **For Orange Pi 5 Plus (32GB):**

        *   Download Link: `ethonarm_orangepi5-plus_24.06.00.img.zip <https://ethereumonarm-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/dlosada/Ecmleamkm-hJkGoIQezdU_kBw8Tl0suJXUlb-kjsZpi67Q?download=1>`_
        *   SHA256 Checksum: ``60b46fd88dc9b6cc6855a48087b8da88e0b2af670e1f1443d6ca0834c9af2125``

        Verify the checksum:

        .. prompt:: bash $

            sha256sum ethonarm_orangepi5-plus_24.06.00.img.zip

        Compare the output to the checksum provided above.

    **Flashing the Image:**

    *   **Using Etcher (Recommended):**
        1.  Download and install Balena Etcher: `https://www.balena.io/etcher/`
        2.  Open Etcher.
        3.  Select the downloaded ``.img.zip`` file.
        4.  Select your MicroSD card (be *absolutely certain* you choose the correct drive!).
        5.  Click "Flash!"

    *   **Using ``dd`` (Linux/macOS - Advanced Users):**
        1.  Identify your MicroSD card device name.  *Be extremely careful; choosing the wrong device will overwrite data!*

            .. prompt:: bash $

                sudo fdisk -l

            Look for a device like ``/dev/mmcblk0`` or ``/dev/sdX`` (where X is a letter).

        2.  Unzip the downloaded image file.  For example, for the Rock 5B:

            .. prompt:: bash $

                unzip ethonarm_rock5b_24.09.00.img.zip

        3.  Flash the image using ``dd``.  Replace ``/dev/mmcblk0`` with the *correct* device name for your MicroSD card.  *Double-check this!*

            .. prompt:: bash $

                sudo dd bs=1M if=ethonarm_rock5b_24.09.00.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fdatasync status=progress

            (Use the correct image filename for the Orange Pi 5 Plus if applicable.)

2.  **Boot the Board:** Insert the MicroSD card into the board, connect the NVMe SSD, connect the Ethernet cable, and connect the power supply.  The initial boot and setup script will take 10-15 minutes. The device will reboot automatically.

3.  **Log In and Change Password:** After the initial setup and reboot, log in via SSH or directly using a monitor and keyboard.

    *   **Finding the IP Address:** If you don't have a monitor connected, you'll need to find the board's IP address.  You can usually find this in your router's administration interface, or use a network scanning tool:

        *   **Using ``nmap`` (install with ``sudo apt-get install nmap`` on your desktop):**

            .. prompt:: bash $

                nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24  # Replace with your network's subnet if different

        *   **Using ``fping`` (install with ``sudo apt-get install fping``):**

            .. prompt:: bash $

                fping -a -g 192.168.1.0/24  # Replace with your network's subnet

    *   **Logging in via SSH:**  Use an SSH client (like PuTTY on Windows, or the ``ssh`` command on Linux/macOS) and connect to the board's IP address:

        .. prompt:: bash $

            ssh ethereum@your_board_IP

        Replace ``your_board_IP`` with the actual IP address.  The default username is ``ethereum`` and the default password is ``ethereum``.

    *   **Direct Login (Monitor/Keyboard):**  If you have a monitor and keyboard connected, log in directly using the same credentials.

    You will be *immediately* prompted to change the default password.  Choose a strong password and remember it! You will need to log in *twice* on the first login â€“ once to trigger the password change, and again with the new password.

Step 1: Setting up the Layer 1 (Ethereum) Node
-----------------------------------------------

The first step is to establish a fully synchronized L1 Ethereum node. This is the foundation for your Optimism Supernode.

1.  **Choose your L1 Clients:** Select a combination of an Execution Layer (EL) client and a Consensus Layer (CL) client.  The original documentation provides details on various supported clients (Geth, Nethermind, Erigon, Besu for EL; Lighthouse, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Lodestar, Grandine for CL).  For this example, we'll use Geth (EL) and Prysm (CL), but you can choose others.

2.  **Start the Consensus Layer (CL) Client:**  The Consensus Layer client (specifically, the Beacon Chain component) *must* be synchronized before you start the Execution Layer client.  Thanks to Checkpoint Sync, this should be relatively quick.

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo systemctl start prysm-beacon

3.  **Monitor the Beacon Chain Sync:** Use `journalctl` to monitor the progress:

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo journalctl -fu prysm-beacon

    Look for logs indicating that the Beacon Chain is synchronized. It should mention being "synced" or "in sync".  Checkpoint Sync usually completes within minutes.

4.  **Start the Execution Layer (EL) Client:** Once the Beacon Chain is synchronized, start the Execution Layer client (Geth in this example):

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo systemctl start geth

5.  **Monitor the EL Client Sync:**  Monitor the Geth sync process:

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo journalctl -fu geth

    This will take significantly longer than the Beacon Chain sync.  Geth will go through several phases, including downloading headers, downloading block bodies, and processing the state.  *It's highly recommended to wait until Geth is fully synchronized before proceeding to the L2 setup.* You can tell Geth is fully synced once it begins regularly importing new blocks at the chain head. You will see "Imported new block headers" messages frequently.

    .. note::
      The original documentation recommends waiting for the Execution Client to finish the "snapshot creation phase".  This is a resource-intensive process.  Monitor the logs, and once you see messages like "Imported new block headers" consistently, it's safe to proceed.

Step 2: Setting up the Layer 2 (Optimism) Node
-----------------------------------------------

Once your L1 node is fully synchronized, you can set up the Optimism (L2) node.

1.  **Configure `op-node`:**  The `op-node` needs to know where to find the L1 node.  Since both L1 and L2 are running on the same machine, we'll use `localhost`.

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo sed -i 's/l1ip/localhost/' /etc/ethereum/op-node.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/l1beaconip/localhost/' /etc/ethereum/op-node.conf

2.  **Start `op-geth`:** This is the Optimism-specific version of Geth.

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo systemctl start op-geth
    
3. **Port Forwarding for `op-geth`:** `op-geth` uses snap sync, so you need open the port 31303.

4.  **Start `op-node`:** This is the core Optimism node software.

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo systemctl start op-node

5.  **Monitor the L2 Sync:**  Monitor the progress of both `op-geth` and `op-node`:

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo journalctl -fu op-geth
        sudo journalctl -fu op-node

    The Optimism sync process (using snap sync) will take time (the documentation estimates 10-15 hours).

Step 3: Configure UFW (Firewall) - Optional but Recommended
------------------------------------------------------------

While often running behind a router (which provides some firewall protection), enabling UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on the node itself adds an extra layer of security.

1.  **Enable SSH Access:**  Allow SSH connections (so you can still access your node remotely):

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo ufw allow ssh

2.  **Allow Ethereum L1 Ports:** Allow the necessary ports for your chosen L1 clients.  For Geth and Prysm (our example):

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo ufw allow 30303/tcp  # Geth (Execution Layer)
        sudo ufw allow 30303/udp  # Geth (Execution Layer)
        sudo ufw allow 13000/tcp  # Prysm (Consensus Layer - Beacon Chain)
        sudo ufw allow 12000/udp  # Prysm (Consensus Layer - Beacon Chain)

3.  **Allow Optimism L2 Ports:**

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo ufw allow 31303/tcp # op-geth
        sudo ufw allow 31303/udp # op-geth

    *(op-node uses the L1 connection, so no additional ports are needed)*

4. **Enable UFW**

    .. prompt:: bash $
     
        sudo ufw enable

    You will see a message indicating the firewall is active

5. **Check UFW Status:** Verify the rules:

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo ufw status

.. note::
    If you're running behind a router, you also need to configure port forwarding on your *router* to forward the same ports (30303 TCP/UDP, 13000 TCP, 12000 UDP, and 31303 TCP/UDP) to your node's internal IP address.  Consult your router's documentation for instructions on how to do this.  UFW manages the firewall *on the node itself*, while port forwarding on the router directs incoming traffic from the internet to your node.  You generally need *both* for external peers to connect.

Step 4: Verification and Maintenance
------------------------------------

*   **Check Synchronization:**  Regularly monitor the logs of all four services (`prysm-beacon`, `geth`, `op-geth`, `op-node`) to ensure they remain synchronized.

*   **System Updates:** Keep your system up-to-date:

    .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade

*   **Resource Monitoring:**  Use tools like `htop`, `top`, or `iotop` to monitor CPU, RAM, and disk I/O usage.  A Supernode is resource-intensive, so keep an eye on these metrics.

*   **Restarting Services:** If you need to restart any of the services, use `sudo systemctl restart <service-name>`. For example:

  .. prompt:: bash $

        sudo systemctl restart geth

Troubleshooting
---------------

*   **Sync Issues:** If any of the clients fall out of sync, check the logs for error messages.  Network connectivity problems are a common cause.  You may need to restart the affected service(s).

*   **Disk Space:** Running out of disk space on the NVMe SSD will cause the node to fail. Monitor disk usage and consider a larger SSD if necessary.

*   **Overheating:** Ensure adequate cooling.  If the board is overheating, the CPU may throttle, slowing down the sync process or causing instability.

* **Phison Controller NVMe drive**: The node may experience issues. Check the compatibility list and change the drive.

This detailed guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for setting up an Optimism Supernode on a Rock 5B (32GB) or Orange Pi 5 Plus.  Remember to carefully follow each step and monitor the system's performance.  Running a Supernode requires a good understanding of Ethereum and Optimism, so be prepared to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
