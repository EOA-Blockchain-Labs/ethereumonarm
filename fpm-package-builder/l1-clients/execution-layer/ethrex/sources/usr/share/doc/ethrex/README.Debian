Ethrex for Ethereum on ARM
==========================

Ethrex is a lightweight, performant, and modular Ethereum execution client
written in Rust, powering next-gen L1 and L2 solutions.

EOA Configuration
-----------------

Configuration file:  /etc/ethereum/ethrex.conf
Data directory:      /home/ethereum/.ethrex
JWT secret:          /etc/ethereum/jwtsecret

The configuration file contains ARGS that are passed to the ethrex binary.
Edit this file to customize your node's behavior.

Systemd Services
----------------

Mainnet:   systemctl start ethrex

View logs: journalctl -u ethrex -f

Network Ports
-------------

Default P2P port: 30303 (TCP/UDP)
  - Forward this port in your router for better peer connectivity

Differences from Upstream
-------------------------

- Runs as 'ethereum' user (not root)
- Data stored in /home/ethereum/.ethrex
- Systemd service with automatic restart

Status
------

NOTE: Ethrex is new to the Ethereum on ARM ecosystem and is still under
active testing. Use with caution in production environments.

Syncing
-------

Ethrex uses Snap Sync, which typically completes in 12-18 hours
on ARM64 devices like Rock 5B or Raspberry Pi 5.

IMPORTANT: You need a synced Consensus Layer client (beacon chain) running
before Ethrex can start syncing.
