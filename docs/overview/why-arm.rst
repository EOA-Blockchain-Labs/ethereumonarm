Why Choose ARM Hardware?
========================

ARM-based Single Board Computers (SBCs) offer the ideal platform for running Ethereum nodes at home. They provide an unbeatable combination of efficiency, affordability, and reliability that traditional computers and cloud services simply cannot match.

1. The Economic Case: Unbeatable ROI
------------------------------------

Running an Ethereum node used to be expensive. ARM hardware changes the equation completely.

**Cloud vs ARM: 1-Year Reality Check**

.. note::
   These cost simulations are estimates generated by AI and may vary based on region, pricing changes, and specific configuration.

We analyzed the cost of running a high-performance cloud instance (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD) using our :ref:`Cloud Image Builder <development_guide>` across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

*   **Cloud Cost (1 Year):** **~$3,000 - $3,700**
    *   *Based on AI-estimated monthly costs of ~$250-310 for comparable specs.*
*   **ARM Device Cost (1 Year):** **~$420**
    *   *Includes Hardware (~$400) + Electricity (~$20).*

**Result:** You can buy **7-8 high-end ARM nodes** for the price of renting **one** cloud instance for a single year.

**Energy Efficiency**

ARM boards consume dramatically less power than x86 alternatives, saving you money and reducing environmental impact.

2. Incredible Performance
-------------------------

Don't let the size fool you. Modern ARM64 architecture is a powerhouse.

*   **8-Core CPUs**: High-performance cores capable of handling heavy execution payloads.
*   **Fast Storage**: Full support for NVMe SSDs via PCIe 3.0, matching desktop storage speeds.
*   **Memory**: Up to 32GB RAM available, enough for:
    *   Ethereum Mainnet L1 (Execution + Consensus)
    *   Layer 2 networks (Optimism, Arbitrum)
    *   Thousands of validators

**Supported Clients**

You are not limited in software choice. ARM supports the full web3 stack:
*   **Execution**: Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Reth, Erigon
*   **Consensus**: Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku, Nimbus, Lodestar
*   **Layer 2**: Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet

3. Home-Native Design
---------------------

ARM boards are designed to live in your home, not a data center.

*   **Silent Operation**: Most boards run fanless (0dB) or with a whisper-quiet low-RPM fan.
*   **Tiny Footprint**: Fits in a closet, on a bookshelf, or next to your router. No bulky tower cases.
*   **Low Heat**: Uses so little power that it won't heat up your room.
*   **High "WAF"**: Wife Acceptance Factor is high due to the discrete, tidy nature of the hardware.

4. The Easiest Way to Run a Node
--------------------------------

We have done the hard work for you.

*   **Plug & Play Images**: Flash the SD card, plug it in, and turn it on.
*   **Auto-Configuration**: Our scripts handle disk formatting, paritioning, and user setup automatically.
*   **Pre-Installed Software**: Geth, Nethermind, Lighthouse, and more are pre-installed as systemd services.
*   **Zero Linux Knowledge Needed**: You don't need to be a sysadmin. If you can flash an SD card, you can run a node.

5. True Decentralization
------------------------

Running on ARM is the ultimate expression of Ethereum's values.

*   **Self-Sovereignty**: You own the hardware. No terms of service, no monthly fees, no one can shut you off.
*   **Client Diversity**: We support minority clients to help strengthen the network.
*   **Geographic Distribution**: Home stakers spread the network across residential ISPs globally, avoiding data center centralization.

Real-World Usage
----------------

**The Home Staker**
*"I run a validator on my Rock 5B. It sits next to my router, completely silent. My electricity bill barely changed (-$1.50/mo), and I have full control over my keys."*

**The Supernode Operator**
*"With a 32GB Orange Pi 5 Plus, I run Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, and an Arbitrum node all on one device for my dev work."*
