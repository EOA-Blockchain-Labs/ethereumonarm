**Ethereum on ARM** is a project that makes it easy to run a full Ethereum node on low-power ARM devices. We provide Plug-and-Play (PnP) Ubuntu Armbian images for a variety of ARM64 boards, allowing users to easily set up and maintain both execution and consensus nodes.

Our main goal is to lower the barrier to entry so more people can participate in the Ethereum network, either by running a full node or by staking from home.

## ‚ú® Main Features

-   **Graphical User Interface (EOA-gui)**: A console menu that simplifies the setup of L1/L2 nodes, for both full and archive nodes (currently in alpha).
-   **Multiple Client Support**:
    -   **Execution Layer**: Geth, Erigon, Besu, Nethermind, Reth.
    -   **Consensus Layer**: Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Lodestar, Lighthouse.
-   **L2 Support**: Compatible with Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, and Gnosis.
-   **Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)**: We support research and implementation for better decentralization.
-   **Client Diversity**: We actively promote the use of minority clients.
-   **Advanced Monitoring**: Ready-to-use dashboards with Prometheus and Grafana for detailed tracking of your node's performance.
-   **Optimized Operating System**: Custom configurations on top of Armbian to ensure your node is stable and efficient.
