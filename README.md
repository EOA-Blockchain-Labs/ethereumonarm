# Ethereum on ARM
Ethereum on ARM is an innovative solution that allows users to easily transform their ARM devices such as the **Radxa Rock 5b, Odroid M1 and Raspberry Pi 4** into **full Ethereum nodes / solo staking nodes** with minimal setup.

This is achieved by using a custom Linux image that runs Ethereum clients as a boot service. Installation is as simple as flashing the image onto the device, connecting an Ethernet cable and plugging in an SSD disk. The project also provides detailed documentation to assist users in managing their Ethereum clients. This makes Ethereum on ARM a great option for individuals and organizations looking to contribute to the decentralized network and support the Ethereum ecosystem.

Visit our documentation page to learn how to install the image and manage the Ethereum clients:
