Running Layer 2 nodes
=====================

You can choose several Layer 2 solutions to run an Ethereum L2 node:

* Polygon_
* Arbitrum_
* Optimism_
* Starknet_
* Gnosis_

.. _Polygon: https://polygon.technology/
.. _Arbitrum: https://arbitrum.io/
.. _Optimism: https://www.optimism.io/
.. _Starknet: https://www.starknet.io/
.. _Gnosis: https://www.gnosis.io/

As explained in the Node Types section there are various L2 technologies to 
scale the Ethereum blockchain and lower the transaction fees.

It is important to keep both L1 and L2 nodes as decentralized as possible and that basically 
means run nodes.

.. note::
  If you have an Ethereum on ARM image installed prior to June 2023 you need to install the clients manually. Otherwise 
  you can skip this step:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install polygon-bor polygon-heimdall arbitrum-nitro starknet-juno starknet-papyrus 
  optimism-op-geth optimism-op-node

Polygon
-------

Polygon is a L2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain that provides faster and more cost-effective 
transactions by using a combination of sidechains and a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

.. note::
  Polygon requires a 4 TB disk to work properly.

  We will sync Polygon using Snapshots for both clients. Take into account that the :guilabel:`Bor` snapshot is huge 
  so it will take more than 10 hours to download and 5 hours to decompress (:guilabel:`Heimdall` is smaller but it will
  take a significant amount of time as well)

In order to run a Polygon node you need to:

1. Download :guilabel:`Bor` Snapshot
2. Decompress and remove the snapshot
3. Download :guilabel:`Heimdall` Snapshot
4. Decompress and remove the snapshot
5. Start and sync the :guilabel:`Heimdall` client
6. Start and sync the :guilabel:`Bor` client

Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~

We included 2 scripts that download and decompress the Polygon Snapshots automatically (for both :guilabel:`Heimdall` and 
:guilabel:`Bor` clients). The recommended steps are as follows:

Run the ``screen`` utility in order to make sure the process continues to run even if you are 
disconnected from the console (this is particularly useful if you are accessing through SSH):

.. prompt:: bash $

  screen

.. note::
  Press ``CONTROL+A  D`` to deattach the console and run the command ``screen -r`` to attach the console again

Once inside screen, run the download script as the ``ethereum`` user:

.. prompt:: bash $

  bor-snapshot

This will download the :guilabel:`Bor` snapshot. Once downloaded, it will be decompressed into the 
correct directory and removed from disk.

Run the :guilabel:`Heimdall` snapshot script:

.. prompt:: bash $

  heimdall-snapshot

This will download the :guilabel:`Heimdall` snapshot. Once downloaded it will be decompressed into the 
correct directory and removed from disk.

Clients
~~~~~~~

Start the :guilabel:`Heimdall` service and check the logs:

.. prompt:: bash $

  systemctl start bor
  journalctl -u bor -f

.. note::
  The order is importante. Please run :guilabel:`Heimdall` first, wait for it to get 
  in sync and start :guilabel:`Bor` afterwards.

Once synced start the :guilabel:`Bor` service and, again, check the logs

.. prompt:: bash $

  systemctl start heimdalld
  journalctl -u heimdalld -f

Congrats, you are running a Polygon node.

Arbitrum
--------

**Arbitrum** uses a technology called Optimistic Rollups to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof 
that is submitted to the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1). By moving much of the transaction processing and 
computation off-chain, Arbitrum reduces congestion and gas fees on the Ethereum network, 
while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.

The Arbitrum :guilabel:`Nitro` client is available.

.. note::
  You need a L1 node to connect to in order to run an Arbitrum node.

First step is to set the IP for your L1 Ethereum node:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo sed -i "s/setip/YOUR_IP/" /etc/ethereum/nitro.conf

For example:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo sed -i "s/setip/192.168.0.10/" /etc/ethereum/nitro.conf

We need to download and decompress the initial snapshot in order to initialize the database. Run:

.. prompt:: bash $

  nitro-snapshot

Once finished, start the :guilabel:`Nitro` client service and wait for the client to get in sync:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo systemctl start nitro
  sudo journalctl -u nitro -f

The Arbitrum node is up and running.

Starknet
--------

StarkNet is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, designed to improve scalability, 
transaction throughput, and efficiency using a technology called Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups.  
This approach allows StarkNet to bundle multiple transactions together, process them off-chain, and 
then submit a proof of their validity to the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1). 

There are 2 available clients for the Starknet Network: :guilabel:`Juno` and :guilabel:`Papyrus`. 
:guilabel:`Papyrus` is currently on Alpha so we will run :guilabel:`Juno`

You can start the client just by running the systemd service:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo systemctl start juno
  sudo journalctl -u juno -f

Gnosis
------

Gnosis Chain, formerly xDai, is an Ethereum-compatible sidechain that serves as a Layer 2 
scaling solution and provides a more efficient environment for Gnosis applications and other 
Ethereum-based projects.

:guilabel:`Gnosis` is already implemented in wome Layer 1 clients so we can use the same client binaries but 
with different configurations.

Like the Layer 1 clients you need to run a Consensus Layer node and an Execution Layer client. Layer 1 
clients guilabel:`Nethermind` and guilabel:`Lighthouse` are already configured to run a Gnosis chain so we just need to start 
the Systemd services:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo systemctl start lighthouse-beacon-gnosis
  sudo journalctl -u lighthouse-beacon-gnosis -f

And

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo systemctl start nethermind-gnosis
  sudo journalctl -u nethermind-gnosis -f

Remember to forward the default ports: `9000` and `30303`

Optimism
--------

Optimism is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that increases the network's scalability by leveraging a 
technology called Optimistic Rollups.

Optimism aims to address Ethereum's high gas costs and slow transaction speeds by moving most transactions off 
the Ethereum mainnet while still maintaining a high level of security.

.. note::

  1. We will sync Optimism using an :guilabel:`Op-Geth` Snapshot. Take into account that this is a large snapshot and 
  it will take a few hours to download and decompress so, please, be patient. You will need a 1TB SSD to be able to 
  download the snapshot and extract it.

  2. You need access to a synced Ethereum L1 node.

In order to run an Optimism node you need to:

1. Download :guilabel:`Op-Geth` Snapshot
2. Decompress and remove the snapshot
3. Set the L1 node IP
4. Start and sync the :guilabel:`Op-Geth` client
5. Start and sync the :guilabel:`Op-Node` client
6. (Optional) Start the :guilabel:`L2Geth` client (not available yet)

Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~

We included 1 script that download and decompress the :guilabel:`Op-Geth` Snapshot automatically. The recommended steps are as follows:

Run the ``screen`` utility in order to make sure the process continues to run even if you are 
disconnected from the console (this is particularly useful if you are accessing through SSH):

.. prompt:: bash $

  screen

.. note::
  Press ``CONTROL+A  D`` to deattach the console and run the command ``screen -r`` to attach the console again

Once inside screen, run the download script as the ``ethereum`` user:

.. prompt:: bash $

  op-geth-preinstall

This will download the :guilabel:`Op-Geth` snapshot. Once downloaded it will be decompressed into the 
correct directory.

Clients
~~~~~~~

Set the synced IP L1 ethereum node:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo sed -i "s/changeme/YOUR_IP/" /etc/ethereum/op-node.conf

For example:

.. prompt:: bash $

  sudo sed -i "s/changeme/192.168.0.10/" /etc/ethereum/op-node.conf

Start the :guilabel:`Op-Geth` service and check the logs:

.. prompt:: bash $

  systemctl start op-geth
  sudo journalctl -u op-geth -f

.. note::
  The order is important. Please run :guilabel:`Op-Geth` first.

Now, start the :guilabel:`Op-Node` client:

.. prompt:: bash $

  systemctl start op-node
  sudo journalctl -u op-node -f

Congrats, you are now running an Optimism Bedrock node.
