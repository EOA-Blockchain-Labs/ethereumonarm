   :description lang=en: About Ethereum on ARM. Learn how custom Linux images enable affordable, energy-efficient Ethereum nodes on ARM single board computers.
   :keywords: Ethereum on ARM project, decentralization, home Ethereum node, low-cost crypto node, ARM blockchain

Introduction
============

**Ethereum on ARM** provides custom Linux images for ARM boards (like the Rock 5B or NanoPC T6). These images make it easy for anyone to run a full, archive, or staking Ethereum node on affordable, low-power hardware.

Our Mission: Decentralization for Everyone
------------------------------------------

The health and safety of the Ethereum network depend on having many different nodes running around the world. Today, many nodes run on centralized cloud services or expensive computers. This creates risks for the network.

As stated in *Mastering Ethereum* by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood:

   *"The health, resilience, and censorship resistance of blockchains depend on having many independently operated and geographically dispersed full nodes. Each full node can help other new nodes obtain the block data to bootstrap their operation, as well as offer the operator an authoritative and independent verification of all transactions and contracts."*
   
**Ethereum on ARM** helps solve this by making node operation accessible, affordable, and efficient.

Why choose ARM hardware?
------------------------
Running an Ethereum node on an ARM board offers clear benefits, including energy efficiency, low cost, and silent operation. For a detailed explanation of these advantages, please visit our :doc:`Why ARM Boards? </overview/why-arm>` page.

What We Offer
-------------
We provide a ready-to-use operating system based on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**, designed specifically for Ethereum performance. Our images include a complete software stack with all major Execution, Consensus, and Layer 2 clients, along with integrated management and monitoring tools.

To explore the full capabilities of our images, check out our :doc:`Main Features </overview/features>` page.

Supported Hardware
------------------
To get started, you will need a compatible ARM board. We support several powerful devices, including the **NanoPC T6**, **Rock 5B**, **Orange Pi 5 Plus**, and **Raspberry Pi 5**.

For a complete list of recommended devices and hardware requirements, please refer to our :doc:`Supported Hardware </overview/supported-hardware>` guide.
