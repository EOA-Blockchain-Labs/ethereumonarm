Recommended Hardware
====================

In order to run an Ethereum node with our images, you will need one of these devices:

* NanoPC T6
* Rock 5B
* Orange Pi 5 Plus
* Orange Pi 5

.. tip::
  We strongly recommend **NanoPC T6, Rock 5B or Orange Pi 5 Plus** boards to run an Ethereum full/staking node. 

This is the recommended hardware to run an **Execution Layer client** + **Consensus Layer client**. 
If you don't know what an Ethereum node is, please visit the :doc:`User Guide section </user-guide/about-user-guide>`.
