Why Choose ARM Hardware?
========================

ARM-based Single Board Computers (SBCs) offer the ideal platform for running Ethereum nodes at home. They provide an unbeatable combination of low power consumption, affordability, reliability, and true decentralization that traditional computers and cloud services simply cannot match.

Energy Efficiency: The Game Changer
------------------------------------

**Power Consumption**

ARM boards consume dramatically less power than alternatives:

\*Based on $0.15/kWh electricity rate, 24/7 operation

**Environmental Impact**

Running an ARM node instead of a desktop PC saves approximately:

* **1,000-2,500 kWh** of electricity per year
* **400-1,000 kg** of CO₂ emissions annually
* Equivalent to planting **20-50 trees** per year

**Real-World Example**

A Rock 5B running Geth + Lighthouse 24/7:

- Daily cost: **$0.04-0.06**
- Monthly cost: **$1.20-1.80**
- Yearly cost: **$15-20**

Compare to a gaming PC running the same setup:

- Daily cost: **$0.50-0.80**
- Monthly cost: **$15-24**
- Yearly cost: **$180-300**

**Savings over 5 years: $800-1,400**

**Cloud vs ARM: 1-Year Reality Check**

.. note::
   These cost simulations are estimates generated by AI and may vary based on region, pricing changes, and specific configuration.

We analyzed the cost of running a high-performance cloud instance (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD) using our :ref:`Cloud Image Builder <development_guide>` across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

*   **Cloud Cost (1 Year):** **~$3,000 - $3,700**
    *   *Based on AI-estimated monthly costs of ~$250-310 for comparable specs.*
*   **ARM Device Cost (1 Year):** **~$420**
    *   *Includes Hardware (~$400) + Electricity (~$20).*

**Result:** You can buy **7-8 high-end ARM nodes** for the price of renting **one** cloud instance for a single year.


**For Stakers**

Lower operational costs mean higher returns:

* **ARM**: ~99% of staking rewards are profit (after electricity)
* **Gaming PC**: ~95% of rewards are profit
* **Cloud VPS**: ~85-90% of rewards are profit
