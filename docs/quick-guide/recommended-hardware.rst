Recommended Hardware
====================

In order to run an Ethereum node with our images, you will need one of these devices:

* NanoPC T6
* Rock 5B
* Orange Pi 5 Plus
* Raspberry Pi 5

.. tip::
  We strongly recommend **NanoPC T6, Rock 5B or Orange Pi 5 Plus** boards to run an Ethereum full/staking node. 

This is the recommended hardware to run an **Execution Layer client** + **Consensus Layer client**. 
If you don't know what an Ethereum node is, please visit the :doc:`User Guide section </user-guide/about-user-guide>`.

.. warning::
  The Raspberry Pi 5 doesn't have native NVMe disk support. If you own a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16 GB of RAM and want to run 
  a node, you can use our image to do so. If not, we strongly recommend to acquire one of the above devices.

.. warning::
  **IMPORTANT for Raspberry Pi 5**
  
  Make sure to buy a disk that doesn't use a Phison controller. Take a look at the SSD list below and see the 
  Controller column of each disk.

The key components are the NVMe disk and the RAM memory. Please, make sure **you get a board with 16 GB of RAM**.

**Before getting the NVMe disk**, please check these 2 sites and look for Mid-Range or High-End :
